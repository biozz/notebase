# notebase

Notebase is my yet another iteration on the "Everything App". This time I am going for my markdown notes.

There are several key points, why I develop this project:

- I need a mobile-friendly web interface for my notes (Obsidian Web is not good enough, and Obsidian App is too heavy)
- I want a well-established query language, like SQL to work with my notes (Dataview and Datacore are still great, but see previous point)
- I want to replace multiple tools I use for everyday life and I always thought they fit nicely into my markdown notes, just need a better interface (like todo lists, finance goals, tv show tracker, habit tracker, etc.)

I document some of my decisions regarding this project in [docs/adrs](./docs/adrs).

# Contributing

I might be interested in some contributions, but because it is an experimental project, I would prefer discussions and maybe code-reviews of the non-optimal or non-conventional parts of the codebase.
