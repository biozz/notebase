# 2025-05-07 Nuxt, pnpm and PicoCSS

I prefer pnpm, because it is fast enough and robust. I find vanilla npm too slow. Bun didn't work for me. Yarn might be good, but I just don't use it enough.

I usually prefer SolidJS, but this time I want to come back to Vue and look at it after 4 years I last wrote something with it. The community has grown a lot and I see more big tech companies use it. My initial experiments with Nuxt were quite smooth.

I am not using SSR at the moment, but I might go for it as soon as I figure out how I prefer running multiple processes in one container. I know that it is not a good practice and there are just too many of the ways to do that.

I want to experiment with semantic markup and that's why I don't use Tailwind/Uno and went for PicoCSS.
